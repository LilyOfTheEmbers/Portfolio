                      <p>I was always into things like coding and as a kid I wanted to be a hacker like I saw in movies and tv.</p>
                      <p>I eventually learned that coding is not at all like what the movies and tv shows showed. But I was not discouraged.</p>
                      <p>I made my way back to coding now because I genuinely have a drive for it and want to learn.</p>
                      <p>Thankfully I found Thinkful and now I am on my way to learning to develop software, and learn to code!</p>
