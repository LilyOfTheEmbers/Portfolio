                      <p>When I was in high school, I wanted to learn how to cook. Not because I wanted that to be my job but I just had a strong love for cooking</p>
                      <p>After going through two years of cooking school, I got a job at a company called Harry & David. There I was tasked with coming with recipes for their line of ingredients.</p>
                      <p>Unfortunately with Covid-19 all of the stores for Harry & David shutdown and led me to figure out what I wanted to do for a job.</p>
                      <p>Thankfully I found Thinkful and now I am on my way to learning to develop software, and learn to code!</p>
